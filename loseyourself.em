## rewrite the lyrics to Lose Yourself by eminem but make the song about hacking

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To hack everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's code on his keyboard already, hackers spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To hack bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the crowd goes so loud
He hacks, but the data won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!

[Chorus]
Snap back to reality, oh there goes your anonymity
Oh, there goes your privacy, you're hacked, it's tragedy
But you've got one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment, will you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 2]
His hacks are ready, his fingers are steady
He's typing on his keyboard, his mind is so heady
He's got the skills, the knowledge, and the tools
To break into any system, and make 'em all look like fools
He's been waiting for this moment, his whole life is like a game
With each hack, he takes more risks, but it's all part of the same
He's a cyber warrior, a ninja in the night
He's got the power, the strength, the will to fight

[Chorus]
Snap back to reality, oh there goes your anonymity
Oh, there goes your privacy, you're hacked, it's tragedy
But you've got one shot, one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment, will you capture it, or just let it slip?

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Just hack it, just hack it
You gotta be willing to take risks, to break the rules
Just hack it, just hack it
Believe in yourself, and in your abilities
Just hack it, just hack it
You can be the greatest hacker of all time
Just hack it, just hack it!

## do it again but with more references to hacking, penetration testing and the dark web

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity
To penetrate the web like a hacker from the dark
In one moment
Would you seize it, or just let it spark?

[Verse 1]
Yo, his fingers are tapping, he's ready to go
He's got his tools on his desk, ready to flow
The keyboard's his weapon, the code's his game
Penetrating networks, he's aiming for fame
He's a pro, a master, a hacker from the dark
He knows the web better than any security guard
But the challenge is on, the clock is ticking
He's facing firewalls, passwords, and encryption

[Chorus]
Snap back to reality, oh there goes his anonymity
Oh, there goes his identity, he's hacked, it's insanity
But he's got one shot, one opportunity
To penetrate everything he ever wanted
One moment, will he seize it, or just let it slip?

[Verse 2]
He's a penetration tester, hired by the best
To break into systems, put them to the test
He's got his tools, his skills, his brains
He's breaking down doors, leaving no remains
He's diving deep into the dark web
Where the hackers are lurking, waiting to stab
But he's not afraid, he's got his plan
To find the loopholes, and make a stand

[Chorus]
Snap back to reality, oh there goes his anonymity
Oh, there goes his identity, he's hacked, it's insanity
But he's got one shot, one opportunity
To penetrate everything he ever wanted
One moment, will he seize it, or just let it slip?

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
Just hack it, just hack it
You gotta be willing to take risks, to break the rules
Just hack it, just hack it
Believe in yourself, and in your abilities
Just hack it, just hack it
You can be the greatest hacker of all time
Just hack it, just hack it!
